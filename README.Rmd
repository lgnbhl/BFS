> Search and download data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office

The `BFS` package allows to search and download public data from the 
[Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS)](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases/data.html){target="_blank"}
in a dynamic and reproducible way.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the released version from CRAN
install.packages("BFS")
```

To get a bug fix, or use a feature from the development version, you can install BFS from GitHub.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install from Github
devtools::install_github("lgnbhl/BFS")
```

## Usage

```{r load BFS}
library(BFS)
```

### Download metadata

To search and download data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, you first need to retrieve information about the available public data sets. 

The function `bfs_get_metadata()` returns a data frame/tibble containing the titles, publication dates, observation periods, data sources, website URLs and download URLs of all the [BFS data sets available](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases/data.html) in a given language. You can get the metadata in German ("de", by default), French ("fr"), Italian ("it") or English ("en"). Note that Italian and English metadata give access to less data sets.

```{r bfs_get_metadata}
meta_en <- bfs_get_metadata(language = "en")

meta_en
```

You can also get the catalog data by language based on the new RSS feed provided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Note that the number of datasets available with `bfs_get_catalog()` may differ from the output of the `bfs_get_metadata()`.

```{r}
catalog_en <- bfs_get_catalog(language = "en")

catalog_en
```

### Search for data

To search for a specific data set title in the BFS metadata, you can use the `bfs_search()` function. This function leverages the R base function `grepl()` but calls the `data` argument first to allow the use of the pipe operator ``%>%``.

```{r bfs_search}
library(magrittr)

meta_en_uni <- bfs_get_metadata("en") %>%
  bfs_search("university students")

meta_en_uni
```

### Download data set

To download a BFS data set, add the related URL link from the `url_px` column of the downloaded metadata as an argument to the `bfs_get_data set()` function. You can choose the language (German, French, Italian or English if any) in which the data set is downloaded with the `language` argument.

```{r bfs_get_dataset}
df_uni <- bfs_get_dataset(url_px = meta_en_uni$url_px[1], language = "en")

df_uni
```

You can access additional information about the downloaded data set using the R base `attributes()` function.

```{r attributes}
attributes(df_uni) %>%
  str()
```

In case the function fails to download the data set, you can have a look at its related BFS webpage using the `url_bfs` link. 

```{r browseURL, eval=FALSE}
browseURL(meta_en_uni$url_bfs[1]) # open webpage
```

Sometimes the PC-Axis file of the data set doesn't exist. You should then use the "STAT-TAB - interactive table" service provided by BFS to download manually the data set.

### Data caching

Data caching is handled using the [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) R package. To open the folder containing all the BFS data sets you already downloaded, you can use the `bfs_open_dir()` function.

```{r bfs_open_dir, eval = FALSE}
bfs_open_dir()
```

If a data set has already been downloaded during the day, the functions `bfs_get_metadata()` and `bfs_get_data set()` retrieve the already downloaded data sets from your local pins caching folder. Caching speeds up code and reduces BFS server requests. However, if a given data set has not been downloaded during the day, the functions download it again to be sure that you have the lastest data available. You can also force the download using the `force` argument.
